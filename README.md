# Multi-Scale Models 

This repo implements a multi-resolution network to evaluate the efficacy of the network as a defense against adversarial attacks. The code evaluates multiple single resolution models and records their performance on an adversarially attacked dataset. We also train a network with three parallel backbones where each backbone takes a different resolution image.
